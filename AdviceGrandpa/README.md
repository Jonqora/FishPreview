# Advice From Grandpa
*He's only angry when you've earned it!*

Advice Grandpa mod gives a huge overhaul to the evaluation system! Restore the **Original** dialogue, keep it **Vanilla**, or use new **Nuclear** dialogue, all with new portrait expressions to match! You can see your actual points total during evaluations, customize the scoring system used, re-evaluate even after earning 4 candles, reschedule grandpa's visit to happen earlier or later in the game, and earn new rewards for achieving a 1, 2, or 3 candle result.


## Features
### Dialogue Changes
Choose from the `"Original"` (pre-SDV v1.05) game dialogue, `"Vanilla"` normal game dialogue, or creative *new* `"Nuclear"` dialogue for grandpa's evaluation response! **Warning: `"Nuclear"` dialogue includes profanity and a lot of sass.** All dialogue variants can be made gender-neutral with an optional setting.

### Expressive Portraits
Grandpa gets a lot more personality with new, expressive portraits edited by [TayLindsey](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/84157593)! A total of **eleven** new facial expressions are used to give flavor and variety to all dialogues. (Some portraits are only used in certain dialogue variants. If you want to experience them all, choose `"Nuclear"` dialogue with a higher difficulty setting.)

### Portrait Art Styles
Thanks to the work of several artists, grandpa's new set of expressive portraits is available in multiple art styles!

### Scoring System Overhaul
Choose your difficulty setting with different point thresholds. Relive the earliest versions of Stardew Valley with only 13 possible grandpa points available to earn... or use the new evaluation system with all 21 available points, but harder thresholds for earning a 4-candle result. This setting defaults to `"Vanilla"`, so you'll need to change it if you want more of a challenge!

**Choose from:** `"Original"`, `"Vanilla"`, `"Hard"` or `"Expert"`

You can customize the schedule for grandpa's initial visit, which usually happens at the beginning of Year 3. If you choose, grandpa can whip you into shape as soon as you arrive on the farm... or you can delay his visit for decades!

### Display Points Total
A re-added feature from early game versions. You can now see your exact point total during evaluations (out of 21 or 13 possible points). You can use a diamond to request a re-evaluation and see your new score at *any* time, even after earning 4 candles.
