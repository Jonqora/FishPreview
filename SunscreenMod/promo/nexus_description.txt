[size=6][b]UV Index (Sunburn Mod)[/b][/size]

This mod adds functional sunscreen to the game that protects you from sunburn. If you spend too long outdoors without sunscreen on a sunny day, you'll get sunburnt... but it won't show up until the next day!

Sunburn will temporarily change your character's skin color. [color=#cc0000][b]NPC villagers who see your tomato-red skin will react in shock![/b][/color] Each villager has a unique set of randomized reactions.

Active sunburn damage lowers your starting health and energy for the day and gives you a slight speed debuff. More severe sunburn damage will take longer to heal (up to 3 days without treatment).

[i]    NOTE: If you only want the skin color changes, you can configure this mod to disable any debuffs.[/i]

Watch the weather channel on TV to be notified of sun conditions for the next day. Higher UV index means greater sunburn risk and faster burn development. UV intensity is semi-randomly determined and is influenced by season, weather conditions, and time of day. Early mornings or evenings spent outside should be very low-risk even on the worst days. But during midday and summer afternoons... [i]watch out[/i].

You can buy protective Sunscreen lotion from Harvey's shop for 100g. You can also buy Aloe Vera Gel (500g), which you can use to treat a sunburn to speed your healing process and reverse [i]some[/i] of the damage.


(If you uninstall this mod while still sunburnt, your character's skin color and everything else will return to normal.)

[size=4][b]USING THE MOD[/b][/size]
The mod should be active as soon as you've installed it correctly. You can check the TV weather channel to see the UV forecast, and you can buy SPF60 Sunscreen and Aloe Vera Gel lotions from Harvey's clinic. When you take sun damage, it will show up as a sunburn [b]the following day[/b]. Then you can run around town as red as a lobster and see all the villager reactions. ;)


[center][b][size=5]Multiplayer[/size][/b][/center]UV Index mod should be fully multiplayer-compatible. (If you find bugs, please report them in the comments section!) All features of this mod should work even if you are the only person who uses it! This mod only affects gameplay for players who install it.

To make sure the skin colors used for sunburned players are synced in multiplayer, use the [code]BurnSkinColorIndex[/code] config setting. Choose three unique skin color values (ranging from 1-24); be sure to choose skin color choices that are not already being used for any player character! Make sure all players who are using the mod have the same skin color values in their UV Index config, arranged in the same order. Then you should be able to see each others' sunburns properly.

If you want to see and poke fun at other players' sunburns but don't want to get sunburnt yourself, you can install this mod and set [code]EnableSunburn[/code] in the config to [code]false[/code].


[size=5][center][b]Config Settings[/b][/center][/size]After running SMAPI at least once with UV Index installed, a [code]config.json[/code] file will be created inside the [code]UVIndex[/code] mod folder. Open it in any text editor to change your config settings for UV Index.
