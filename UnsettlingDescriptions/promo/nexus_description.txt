[size=6][b]Unsettling Item Descriptions[/b][/size]

[b][size=5][center]Q&A[/center][/size][/b][size=3][b]Q: Geez, those are some WEIRD nature facts. How much of this stuff is true?[/b][/size]
[b][color=#e69138]A. Most of it is true![/color][/b] Don't treat us like a textbook—we can't [i]guarantee[/i] the truth of every description. But we [b]did[/b] do a lot of research for this mod, and tried to avoid spreading false information as facts. Remember that some of the animals, plants, and minerals in Stardew Valley are fictional or only loosely based on the real world. We may have gotten more creative for those. :)

By and large, though, the weirdest and most bizarre nature facts revealed in this mod are all [b]true[/b]. We figure that weird-but-true facts are a lot more unsettling than fiction, anyway. Isn't it more uncomfortable when it's real?

[size=3][b]Q: Does this mod make it harder to play the game?[/b][/size]
[b][color=#e69138]A. Brand-new players [i]may[/i] be disadvantaged by using this mod.[/color][/b] Sometimes, a helpful description relating to an item's purpose has been replaced with unsettling but less-informative text. If you're not already familiar with the purpose and use of most in-game items, you might have a harder time. We recommend that players use the [url=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/]wiki[/url] to look up unfamiliar items!

The amount of information left out is [b]small[/b], and should not be a problem for experienced players. All descriptions for seed items, for example, still contain season, growth, and harvest information.

[size=3][b]Q: Hey! I found a description that isn't very unsettling.[/b][/size]
[b][color=#e69138]A. Feel free to suggest a better one![/color][/b] Our [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s3Upkb2qTd6m02gyfdLdIgkqdHE1TD2ga0LU8BdDnKY/edit?usp=sharing]spreadsheets[/url] are open for anyone to comment with suggestions or improvements. Generally speaking, the creepiness of individual descriptions in this mod may vary. Some are weird, and a few are just silly.

We are actively collecting suggestions for "silly" descriptions also, and will consider expanding this mod in the future to include an option making all descriptions silly, all unsettling, or fifty-fifty randomized. This depends on how many new descriptions we can collect, so please contribute your ideas!

[size=4][b]USING THE MOD[/b][/size]
You should see the new item descriptions show up right away. Almost every description for objects, craftables, boots, weapons, and tools has been re-written. (There were a few that were already so unsettling we didn't change them.) Some—but not all—descriptions for hats, clothing, and buildings have been re-written as well.

If you want to help add to this mod by suggesting description ideas for missed items, you can join our contributor group by commenting on our [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s3Upkb2qTd6m02gyfdLdIgkqdHE1TD2ga0LU8BdDnKY/edit?usp=sharing]shared google speadsheet document![/url]
