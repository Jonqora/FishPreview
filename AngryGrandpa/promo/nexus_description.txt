[size=6][b]Angry Grandpa[/b][/size]
[i]He's only angry when you've earned it!
[/i]
In early 2016 versions of Stardew Valley, grandpa's evaluation was much tougher. There were fewer ways to earn points (13 total), and 12 points were required to obtain 4 candles. If you disappointed grandpa, his original dialogue was pretty harsh...

[i]Original 1-candle result:[/i][spoiler][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1303/images/6324/6324-1594426427-1937082677.png[/img]
[right][i]yikes![/i][/right][/spoiler]
Angry Grandpa mod gives a huge overhaul to the evaluation system! Restore the [b]Original[/b] dialogue, keep it [b]Vanilla[/b], or use new [b]Nuclear[/b] dialogue, all with new portrait expressions to match! You can see your actual points total during evaluations, customize the scoring system used, re-evaluate even after earning 4 candles, reschedule grandpa's visit to happen earlier or later in the game, and earn new rewards for achieving a 1, 2, or 3 candle result.

[b]Can be used on existing late-game saves:[/b] Angry Grandpa comes with a [code]reset_evaluation[/code] console command. You can use this command to redo all evaluations on an existing save and experience everything new from scratch.


[center][b][size=5]Features[/size][/b][/center][b][size=3]Dialogue Changes[/size][/b]
Choose from the [code]"Original"[/code] (pre-SDV v1.05) game dialogue, [code]"Vanilla"[/code] normal game dialogue, or creative [i]new[/i] [code]"Nuclear"[/code] dialogue for grandpa's evaluation response! [b][color=#ff0000]Warning:[/color][/b] [code]"Nuclear"[/code] dialogue includes profanity and a lot of sass. All dialogue variants can be made gender-neutral with an optional setting.

[b][size=3]Expressive Portraits[/size][/b]
Grandpa gets a lot more personality with new, expressive portraits edited by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/84157593]TayLindsey[/url]! A total of [b]eleven[/b] new facial expressions are used to give flavor and variety to all dialogues. (Some portraits are only used in certain dialogue variants. If you want to experience them all, choose [code]"Nuclear"[/code] dialogue with a higher difficulty setting.)

[right][i]and many more...[/i][/right][b][size=3]Scoring System Overhaul[/size][/b]
Choose your difficulty setting with different point thresholds. Relive the earliest versions of Stardew Valley with only 13 possible grandpa points available to earn... or use the new evaluation system with all 21 available points, but harder thresholds for earning a 4-candle result. This setting defaults to [code]"Vanilla"[/code], so you'll need to change it if you want more of a challenge!

[b]Choose from:[/b] [code]"Original"[/code], [code]"Vanilla"[/code], [code]"Hard"[/code] or [code]"Expert"[/code]

[i]How many points are required to get candles?[/i]
[spoiler][code]  result |"Original"|"Vanilla"|"Hard"|"Expert"|
1 candle |    0     |    0    |  0   |   0    |
2 candles|    4     |    4    |  10  |   15   |
3 candles|    8     |    8    |  14  |   18   |
4 candles|    12    |    12   |  18  |   21   |

You can customize the schedule for grandpa's initial visit, which usually happens at the beginning of Year 3. If you choose, grandpa can whip you into shape as soon as you arrive on the farm... or you can delay his visit for decades!

[b][size=3]Display Points Total[/size][/b]
A re-added feature from early game versions. You can now see your exact point total during evaluations (out of 21 or 13 possible points). You can use a diamond to request a re-evaluation and see your new score at [u]any[/u] time, even after earning 4 candles.

[b][size=3]More Rewards[/size][/b]
With bonus rewards enabled, grandpa's shrine will give you new, useful gifts for reaching milestones under 4 candles. The new bonus rewards for 1+, 2+ and 3+ candles are available to everyone in a multiplayer game.

[i]Peek at the new rewards:[/i]
[spoiler][list][*]1+ candles - ancient seed artifact
[*]2+ candles - dinosaur egg
[*]3+ candles - prismatic shard
[/list][/spoiler]
If you earn 4 candles in your first evaluation, you will be given all three bonus rewards plus the usual vanilla reward for 4 candles. If you install this mod after already earning 4 candles, re-doing the evaluation will give you the bonus rewards. Bonus rewards can be disabled in the config.

[b][size=3]Farmhand Rewards[/size][/b]
In vanilla multiplayer games, scoring is done individually, but only one Statue of Perfection (the 4-candle reward) can be obtained from grandpa's shrine. With the [code]StatuesForFarmhands[/code] setting enabled, Angry Grandpa now allows every player in a game to receive their own statue once they've earned 4 candles.

If you install this mod on an existing save, it will assume that any existing Statue of Perfection in the game world belongs to the host. The host player will [b]not[/b] be able to receive extra statues by using the [code]reset_evaluation[/code] command.

[size=4][b]USING THE MOD[/b][/size]
If you are using this mod on a NEW save, or one where grandpa has not visited yet, choose whatever config settings you like! They will be used when grandpa makes his future visits. 

If you are currently in Year 1 and want grandpa to visit right away, you can set [code]YearsBeforeEvaluation[/code] to [code]0[/code].

If you are using this mod on an EXISTING save (grandpa has already visited), you have two options:

[list=1]
[*]You can request a re-evaluation at grandpa's shrine. Angry Grandpa mod enables infinite re-evaluations even after earning 4 candles, and the option to request one should be available right away.
[*]You can [b]reset[/b] all past evaluations with a special command by typing [code]reset_evaluation[/code] in the SMAPI console. If the current in-game year is greater than the [code]YearsBeforeEvaluation[/code] setting in config, grandpa should appear the next morning.
[/list]
[left][b]PLEASE NOTE: to activate the Bonus Rewards or Statues for Farmhands features, you must complete a grandpa evaluation OR re-evaluation event with this mod installed.[/b][/left]

[center][b][size=5]Multiplayer[/size][/b][/center]Angry Grandpa mod is HIGHLY customizable in multiplayer. As long as you don't change [code]YearsBeforeEvaluation[/code], all features of this mod should work even if you are the only person who uses it! This mod only affects gameplay for players who install it.

If multiple players install this mod, each player can have personalized settings. You can set individual dialogue variants, portrait use, scoring settings, and even bonus rewards! Farmhands can use the [code]StatuesForFarmhands[/code] feature even if the host player does not have this mod installed. (Warning: if the host player has not installed this mod, they can only obtain a Statue of Perfection if they are the [b]first[/b] player to collect it.)

If you want to use the scheduling feature of this mod in multiplayer, all players must have this mod installed and all players must use the [b]same[/b] setting for [code]YearsBeforeEvaluation[/code].

If you install this mod on an existing multiplayer save and want to redo past evaluations, the [code]reset_evaluation[/code] command must be used by the [b]host player[/b].


[size=5][center][b]Config Settings[/b][/center][/size]After running SMAPI at least once with Angry Grandpa installed, a [code]config.json[/code] file will be created inside the [code]AngryGrandpa[/code] mod folder. Open it in any text editor to change your config settings for Angry Grandpa.

[b]Optional:[/b] Angry Grandpa Mod includes [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098]Generic Mod Config Menu[/url] (GMCM) support.
